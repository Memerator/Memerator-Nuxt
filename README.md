# Memerator Nuxt

This repository houses the source code for the Memerator website (and eventually API).
It is a rewrite of the original, closed source Memerator.me website, rewritten in Nuxt.js and made open source for the community.

Memerator is a meme website that allows users to rate memes on a scale of 1-5, and submit their own memes to be rated by the community.
You can learn more about its history [here](https://chew.wiki/view/Memerator).

If you have a bug report with this site, please make an issue. 
We are currently in the process of migrating stuff from the old site, so no new suggestions are needed at this time.
